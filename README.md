# 📝 Blog-api-project

This is a basic blog application built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, using **EJS** for templating. It allows users to view and edit blog posts via a simple web interface. The project is divided into two key files:  
- `server.js` makes **API requests**  
- `index.js` handles **API requests and core logic**  

> ⚠️ Note: Both `server.js` and `index.js` must be running for the app to work.
